# Intel (Homepage Clone)

This repository is a front-end practice project where I recreated the look-and-feel and a few interactions inspired by Intel’s public marketing pages.

**Important:** This is an educational clone made for learning and portfolio practice only. I’m not affiliated with Intel, and this repo is not an official Intel product. Intel name, logos, and related marks belong to their respective owners.

## About Me

Hi — I’m **<YOUR NAME HERE>**, a developer who’s focused on getting really good at building clean, responsive UI and shipping projects that feel polished.
I learn best by rebuilding real-world interfaces from scratch and then pushing past “it looks similar” into “it behaves right”: layout details, spacing rhythm, hover states, scroll behavior, and the small transitions that make a page feel intentional.

I’m using this Intel homepage clone as a way to practice the full front-end loop:

- **Break down a complex UI into manageable pieces** (navigation, hero area, content sections, footer)
- **Translate design into CSS** with consistent typography, alignment, and spacing
- **Add interactivity with JavaScript** (scroll-driven transitions, state changes, click targets)
- **Debug the details** (z-index layering, fixed positioning, hover/active states, and pointer events)

### Why I built this

I wanted a project that wasn’t a toy example — something with a real-world layout and interaction density.
Cloning a well-designed marketing page is a practical way to level up because it forces me to think about:

- How content hierarchy is communicated with type scale and spacing
- How navigation dropdowns and overlays should behave
- How a hero section can “sell” a message through motion and composition
- How to keep the experience consistent across different screen sizes

### What this project says about how I work

- **I’m detail-oriented.** I care about the micro-interactions that users feel even if they don’t consciously notice them.
- **I’m systematic.** I like to identify repeated patterns (buttons, nav items, sections) and implement them consistently.
- **I iterate quickly.** I’ll ship a baseline, then refine: spacing, timing, states, edge cases.
- **I learn by doing.** I choose projects that stretch me and force me to practice practical skills instead of just reading about them.

### Skills I’m actively building

- **HTML structure & semantics:** organizing markup so it’s readable and maintainable
- **CSS fundamentals:** layout (flex/grid), layering, positioning, responsive behavior, typography
- **JavaScript for UI:** DOM manipulation, event handling, state management for interactive elements
- **UI engineering habits:** naming consistency, component-like thinking even in vanilla setups, keeping changes minimal and testable

### What I’m proud of in this build

Even as a learning project, I approached it like a real UI implementation:

- Building a **fixed navigation** with dropdown-style content regions
- Creating a **hero section with scroll-driven transitions** and active-state indicators
- Paying attention to **layout composition** across sections (hero → cards → footer)

### What’s next for me

This repo is part of a bigger goal: building confidence and speed in front-end implementation so I can move from “I can code it” to “I can ship it cleanly.”
My next steps are usually some combination of:

- improving responsiveness and edge-case behavior
- tightening accessibility basics (keyboard navigation, focus states, semantics)
- refactoring repeated UI patterns into cleaner structure

If you’re reviewing this repo, the most helpful feedback you can give me is around UI structure, CSS maintainability, and how to simplify the JavaScript logic without losing clarity.
